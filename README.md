Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project lane lines are detected in images using Python and OpenCV.  

This project includes  a file containing project code and a file containing a brief write up explaining the solution. The code file is called P1.ipynb and the write-up template is writeup_p1.md 

To meet specifications in the project, take a look at the requirements in the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view)
